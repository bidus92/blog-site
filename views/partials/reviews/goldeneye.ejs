            Goldeneye brought James Bond to the modern age in the 1990s, while also retaining the original formula
            that made a classic James Bond Film. This would be the peak of the classic formula however, where Pierce Brosnan
            does an amazing job portraying bond, the quality of the films declines after this one until Casino Royale in 2006. That's for another 
            discussion (let us know your thoughts below ðŸ˜‰) What factors about Goldeneye make it a staple in the franchise and made it work so well?
