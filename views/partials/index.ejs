            <p>When it comes to movie reviews, we make it a point to have a well-rounded take
            on all of the films we review: the good, the bad, the so-bad-their-good, and the mid (aka the ugly). That's only a part
            of it. What really makes us different is....<span id="exclamation">YOU!!!!</span> You get to review any movie you like and post about it! Unbiased and unfiltered, 
            you will get to give your own personal take and share with others your thoughts about your favorite flicks! This site can't exist without you, so let us know what you
            think about our reviews and make some of your own!
            </p>
